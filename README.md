# MNIST-DIGIT-CLASSIFICATION-using-ANN
The MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, has been 
a benchmark for testing machine learning algorithms, particularly in the realm of neural 
networks. In this project, we propose a neural network model for accurately classifying 
handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.Our neural network architecture comprises 
multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for 
classification. We employ techniques such as ReLU activation, max-pooling, and dropout 
regularization to enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting. The training process 
involves optimizing the model using the Adam optimizer and minimizing the categorical cross
entropy loss function. We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1 score on both training and testing datasets.Through extensive 
experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we achieve a high classification accuracy on the 
MNIST test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our neural network approach for digit 
recognition tasks.This project contributes to the field of machine learning by showcasing the 
capabilities of neural networks in handling image classification tasks and provides insights into 
optimizing model performance for real-world applications.
